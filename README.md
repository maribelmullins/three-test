# Testing THREE.js
THREE uses modules.  Parcel is used for building.
I'm copying the code I need in to source.  
NPM install is just needed for parcel.

This is deployed on netlify: https://bright-mousse-6903a7.netlify.app/

## load parcel
`nmp i` or `yarn install`

## run dev
`yarn start`

## run build
`yarn build`
